# Midi-Player

A complete rewrite of Bisqwit's midi player.
This program plays *.mid files using OPL-3.

The original program can be found at:

and:

Note:

In a few cases sections of code have been converted without a full understanding of all the details. However, all midi files that have been tried play correctly.
